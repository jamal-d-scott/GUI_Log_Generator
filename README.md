# GUI_Log_Generator
Students who are employed with the Campus Security Department at Elizabethtown College are tasked with patrolling our campus to ensure the safety of our students and faculty. Our job description includes observing, reporting and documenting. Documentation is done on a log sheet that the student patrol officers must carry around.   

In this modern age, most forms of mobile documentation are digital. I challenged myself to develop an app/website/program in which students can discontinue paper log usage and generate their logs digitally. The program will include: 

-A log in and registration system complete with efficient error checking. 
-User account recovery. -A fully interactive graphical user interface. 
-Auto-log generation.* -
User editable log to correct information. 
-Network capabilities to digitally transport the log back to the office to be printed.  *

Currently, I am creating "nodes" (key buildings, landmarks, and paths) as elements of an adjacency matrix with path weights and using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between our logged positions to generate a path. This path will be fitting as SPO's generally take the same path to reached the specified locations.

Currently, this build is not complete. I will be making finalizations this month.
